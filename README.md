Automated builds of [nilaoda/BBDown](https://github.com/nilaoda/BBDown) with pre-compiled binaries for multiple platforms.

## ü§ñ What is this?

This repository automatically monitors the upstream [BBDown](https://github.com/nilaoda/BBDown) project and creates new releases with pre-compiled binaries whenever the upstream code is updated. 

**Note: This repository does NOT contain source code.** All builds are generated directly from the original [nilaoda/BBDown](https://github.com/nilaoda/BBDown) repository.

## üì¶ Available Platforms

Each release includes pre-compiled binaries for:

- **Windows**: x64, ARM64
- **Linux**: x64, ARM64  
- **macOS**: x64, ARM64

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/CrueChan/BBDown-AutoBuild/releases/latest)
2. Download the appropriate version for your platform
3. Extract the archive
4. Run the `BBDown` executable directly

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [original project documentation](https://github.com/nilaoda/BBDown#readme).

## üîÑ How it works

- **Daily Check**: GitHub Actions runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC to check for upstream updates
- **Smart Detection**: Only builds when new commits are detected in the upstream repository
- **Automatic Release**: Creates a new release with all platform binaries when updates are found
- **Version Format**: `vYYYYMMDD-{commit}` (e.g., `v20250628-a1b2c3d`)
